#Calculator - A google extension

##Features
###The calculator Chrome extension keeps track of a total, and the user adds to or subtracts from this total. The extension has an options menu where the user can decide to add inputs together or subtract the inputs from the total. Additionally it also has a 'clear total' option. Additionally, the extension also makes use of context menus in order to select text and then right click on it in order to add it to the total.

##What I Learned
###Over the course of doing this project, I was able to have a good grasp on the basics of building a google chrome extension. I also learned how to use jquery and how to use chrome apis in order to store values across different contexts within the extension. Overall it was a good experience because I have never written in html or javascript before, and this provided a good introduction to those languages.

##What Didn't Work
###My initial idea was to base my extension on the tutorial mentioned, but to use tensorflow's image recognition apis in order to build an extension that would be able to identify images on the screen. However, this proved to be too difficult a challenge for my hack-a-thing and I instead pivoted to build a simpler extension that functioned as a calculator.
